# Percussion Ensemble DB Backend

This is the backend for a full stack web app built with Node.js, Express, React, Python, and Postgres. This piece of the application provides percussion ensemble data from the database to the React front end.

The data is provided to the database from a separate Python script that scrapes 3 percussion ensemble publishers' websites.

The purpose of the application is to bring together percussion ensemble data into one big list for users to browse.
